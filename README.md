# CS433_Project_2_simple_shell

Using this as a changelog:

update to issue: can use cygwin / g++ to compile and test the output of the program, not sure if it will cause issues again while porting the program to the server

TO_DO:
go through command history, assign args[i] = history[i] until NULL then call execute again

child process should do execvp and parent should wait for child
