# CS433_Project_2_simple_shell

Using this as a changelog:

update to issue: can use cygwin / g++ to compile and test the output of the program, not sure if it will cause issues again while porting the program to the server

TO_DO:
currently we fork, but nothing else, need to have child process invoke execvp() using the args[] created from tokenize()
